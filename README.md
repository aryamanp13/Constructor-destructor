# Constructor-destructor

# Aim: To study Constuctors and Destructors

## Theory: 

Constuctors
1. A constructor is a special member function of a class that is automatically called when an object of that class is created.
2. Its primary purpose is to initialize the objectâ€™s properties or allocate resources.

Constructors can be categorized into three main types:

1. Default Constructor:A constructor that either has no parameters or has all parameters set to default values.
   
2. Parameterized Constructor:A parameterized constructor takes one or more parameters. This allows the programmer to initialize an object with specific values at the time of creation.

3. Copy Constructor: A copy constructor is a special constructor that initializes a new object as a copy of an existing object. It takes a reference to an object of the same class as its parameter.


Destructors: Destructor is a special member function of a class that is automatically called when an object of that class is destroyed.
The primary purpose of a destructor is to release resources that the object may have acquired during its lifetime, such as memory or file handles.

## Algorithm : Default Constructor
1. Start
Class Definition

2.Define a class named construct.

3.Declare public member variables:
int a.
int b.
Default Constructor

4.Implement a default constructor:

Initialize a to 10.

Initialize b to 20.

5.Display Method

Define a method void display():
Print the values of a and b to the console in the format:
"a = [value of a]"
"b = [value of b]"

6.Main Function
Create an instance of the construct class named constructor.

Call the display() method on constructor to output the values of a and b.

7.End
